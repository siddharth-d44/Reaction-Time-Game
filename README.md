# Reaction-Time-Game

This game is a two-player game that tests the reaction speed of each player. The game ticks down for three seconds and a different colored light turns on for each tick. The order of lights is green, yellow, and red. The red light is on for an unknown amount of time, and when it turns off, each player is supposed to click their respective button. Whoever clicks their button first is the winner. This is indicated as the blue light on the winning player's side will remain on while the blue light on the losing player's side turns off. The game restarts after one second. All software is developed using the Arduino IDE. The game is built using an Arduino Uno microcontroller, a solderless breadboad, as well as a variety of components including current-limiting resistors, buttons, LED lights, and jumper wires.
